# Reminder-App
The application operates by receiving user-inputted date and time information, and in addition to generating notifications, it also stores this data in an Excel file. When the user inputs a specific date and time, the app not only sets up notifications but also maintains a record of these entries within an Excel file. This dual functionality not only ensures timely alerts but also allows users to keep track of their scheduled events in a structured and accessible format. This feature enhances the overall utility of the application, providing users with a comprehensive solution for both timely reminders and organized data management.
